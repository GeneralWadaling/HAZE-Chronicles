# HAZE Chronicles
A Unciv ruleset mod that features a fictional world ravaged by HAZE Catastrophe - an abnormal disaster caused by mysterious white particles, only known as HAZE, that decays any organic compounds it touches. Civilizations haven't been destroyed - You'll lead one of the coalitions of people who survived, would you dedicate finding a way to restore the world before, or you would construct a new world order in the pile of white rot?
