# HAZE-Chronicles
A Unciv ruleset mod that features an fictional world ravaged by HAZE Catastrophe - an abnormal disaster caused by mysterious white particles, only known as HAZE, that decays any organic compounds it touches. You'll lead one of the coalitions of survived people, would you dedicate finding a way to restore the world before, or you would construct a new world order?
